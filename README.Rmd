# ProjectTasks

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of ProjectTasks is to create a central location for functions to 
produce plots and tables for various projects.  This will allow for the same
quality to be generated for each project.  No more multiple versions fo the 
same / similar script.

## Installation

You can install the development version of ProjectTasks like so:

``` r
if(!require(remotes)){install.packages("remotes")}  #install if needed
install_github("leppott/ProjectTasks", force=TRUE)
```

## Current Tasks

* Fish Tissue Surveys (NLA, NRSA, and Great Lakes)

    + CDF plots
